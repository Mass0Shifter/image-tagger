# image-tagger
This is a web-based application that enables you to quickly tag your pictures with one click. E.g Say you have twenty(20) pictures shot in your church and you quickly want to put your church logo on each picture at strategic positions. Then you are in the right place.

## Inspiration (Precious)
A friend👩 in My Church⛪ Media🎞 Department was complaining how tedious it was to tag pictures taken during service.
So I decided to save them a life time of stress😎.
I mean It's Gods work😇 we are doing here.

## So How to use it(In case your church needs it too).

* Step 1: Get Your church logo and name it exactly "Tag-Template.png" (Properly Sized In Photoshop:Pay attention to the logo pixel size verse the image pixel size).
* Step 2: Place it in the Image Template Folder.
* Step 3: Collect your Images regardless of the amount and place them in the "Images" folder.
* Step 4: In the "Images" folder with your explorer select/highlight all and hit "F2" or right click and select rename just call them "picture" and Hit enter.
* Step 5: Fire Up the "index.html".

### Raw Image Name
* Step 6: Enter the "Total Amount Of Images" you copied to the "Images" Folder.
* Step 7: Ignore The "Prefix Name" (You can experiment on it).
* Step 8: Ignore The "Surfix Name" (except your file in not "png" Images the change the "png" to "jpg").

### Export Image Name
* Step 9: Do you want a name for your exported images then change the Prefix

### Tag Location
* Step 10: Now Select the location you want the logo to appear in your image. (Note this applies to all the image you have loaded into the Images folder)

(🤷🏽‍♂️Obviously you would probably want an offset from the edges of the Location Selected for the tag/logo)
* Step 11: Enter A vertical and horizontal value for the spacing or offset from edges (Experiment with a picture and get your desired result before bulk processing✌🏼)

* Step 11: you are all set, now hit the "Process Bulk Data" button and watch your hours of stress full positioning happen in a few minutes if they are much tho.
